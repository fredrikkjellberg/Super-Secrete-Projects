Super-Secrete-Projects
======================

Here is a small collection of code that I have no problem sharing with the public, both small private projects and some schoolwork. Vanilla SJ visualizations, web data mining scripts, R functions, Responsive CSS framework etc.

However, if you are a recruiter and interested in some of the “real” projects I am currently working on, projects I really cant host publicly on GitHub due to HIPAA regulations, NDAs, pending patents, and Engineering schools Honor codes please email or message me and I can perhaps arrange something☺
